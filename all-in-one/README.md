# All in one

This project has a single stack which contains the client and server and uses the default network. Super simple.

## Running

  1. just start the only stack
      ```bash
      docker-compose up
      ```
  1. you'll see the logs of the client doing a curl once per second
  1. `ctrl+c` to exit
  1. remove the stack
      ```bash
      docker-compose down
      ```
